# Markdown Formatting Demo

This document demonstrates all the markdown formatting that will now render beautifully in your QA System!

## What's Changed?

Your AI responses will now display with **proper formatting** instead of showing raw markdown characters like `#`, `##`, `*`, `**`, etc.

### Features

#### Headings Work Properly
All heading levels (H1 through H6) now display with appropriate sizes and colors.

#### Text Formatting
- **Bold text** stands out clearly
- *Italic text* is properly italicized
- ***Bold and italic*** works together
- `Inline code` has subtle highlighting

#### Lists Look Great

**Unordered Lists:**
- First item with bullet point
- Second item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
- Third item

**Ordered Lists:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B

#### Code Blocks

Inline code like `const x = 10;` is highlighted.

Multi-line code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("User"));
```

#### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote with elegant styling.
> It can span multiple lines and has a purple accent border.

#### Tables

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Headings | Raw # symbols | Properly styled headings |
| Bold | Raw ** symbols | **Actually bold** |
| Lists | Raw - or * | Clean bullet points |
| Code | Plain text | Syntax highlighted |
